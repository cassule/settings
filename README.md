# Why did I create this repository?

As programmers there are several reasons that lead us to change computers, sometimes we will start in another company, maybe we change for a faster and more modern one. No matter the reason, I think everyone agrees that setting up the development environment is a tedious thing and can take a lot of time.

This repository was born out of the need to save time whenever I need to configure my development environment on a new computer. So the settings are specific to my development stack and my personal tastes of colors and interface, however if you want to use it, feel free.

I already mention that I like to use Linux as my main system and work with Stack: Node, React and React Native. However you can find programs and settings that are also applicable to windows mainly using WSL.
